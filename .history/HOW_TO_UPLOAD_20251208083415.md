## 🎓 For Developers

### Current Implementation

**File Input Element:**

```jsx
<input
  type="file"
  ref={frontFileRef}
  style={{ display: "none" }}
  accept="image/*,application/pdf,.doc,.docx,.xlsx,.xls,.txt"
  multiple
  onChange={(e) => handleFileChange(e, "docFront")}
/>
```

**Click Handler:**

```jsx
onClick={() => frontFileRef.current.click()}
```

This triggers the native file picker from your device.

### To Extend

To send files to a server, modify `handleFileUpload()` in `src/App.jsx`:

```javascript
const handleFileUpload = async (field, files) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  files.forEach((file) => {
    formData.append("file", file);
  });

  const response = await fetch("/api/upload", {
    method: "POST",
    body: formData,
  });
};
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Save Files to Server

1. Create backend API endpoint
2. Modify `handleFileUpload()` in App.jsx
3. Send FormData to endpoint
4. Store files on server

### To Add File Preview

1. Use `FileHandler.readFileAsDataURL()`
2. Display as image in UI
3. Show file preview before upload

### To Show Upload Progress

1. Use XMLHttpRequest with progress event
2. Display progress bar
3. Show upload percentage
